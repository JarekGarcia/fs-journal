08. What is the purpose of ***wireframing***?
    > | Wireframing is used to plan out your project and what the layout will be so you are prepared to build upon that |

09. Do you think wireframes are worth the time, energy, and effort that they require? Why or Why not?
    > | Yes I think wireframes are essential to a new project from scratch, because you can plan before hand what you intend it to look like then code it in. Instead of coding and trying to get things looking how you want them to. I think it could save a lot of time. |
